# One-Shot-Facial-Recognition

Modern facial recognition technology plays a crucial role in various daily activities such as Authentication and Security. Moreover, these applications require accurate prediction over low number of sample availability. This repo demonstrates a Transfer Learning based Siamese Network to classify images for N-way one shot learning. This approach uses the Viola Jones algorithm as a preprocessing optimization step to focus and extract a region of interest (ROI) containing facial features within an image. The cropped region is then passed through a Siamese Network which uses VGG-Face as the twin networks, followed by calculating the covariance distance between extracted features, before being passed through a sigmoid activation function which produces the final output. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 93.2% over 1344 test images for 100-way one shot learning.
